Hello and welcome to my Quake 2 Dodgeball mod! Let's give a rundown of the basics. Hope you have fun playing!

-INSTALLATION-
Create a new folder under wherever you have Quake 2 program files located. Then, download the gamex86.dll, config.cfg and pak0.pak
files into the new folder you just created. From baseq2, copy over the maps.lst file and the players, save and video folders, to 
the new folder. From there back under the Quake 2 directory, right click the quake2.exe file, then click "Create Shortcut" from the
pop-up menu. Drag that shortcut to a location you can easily access, such as Desktop. Right click the shortcut again, select 
"Properties", then at the end of the string in the input bar labelled "Target:", type in " +set game [name of your mod folder]". Now
run the shortcut, and get ready to enjoy the mod! To enjoy the game, select Multiplayer from the main menu, then select the map 
labelled "Q2_Dodgeball".

-CONTROLS-

- Press left click to throw the dodgeball.
- If you are about to get hit, press left click again to catch the dodgeball.
- Walk over the ball while holding left click to pick up the ball.

-GAME RULES-
The gameplay goes as such: each player will try to knock out their opponent as much as possible. The players will share one ball,
starting with the owner of the server serving. The goal is to hit the opponent as much as possible, and whoever reaches the goal 
amount of knockouts first wins.
